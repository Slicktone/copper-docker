# Docker assessment from Dev Ops

# 
### Haven't quite yet figured out how to get the Makefile in there to play nice so I left some of the ways that I researched how it should look for further testing.
### I decided to use Alpine Linux because of how compact and light it is.
### Finding some interesting errors in the Dockerfiles when I run start to build the images with "docker-compose build"
### The errors have been mainly linux based (pathing, configurations, etc.)

### I decided not to move forward with connecting the database to wordpress because I wanted to figure out my Dockerfiles and Container builds first.
